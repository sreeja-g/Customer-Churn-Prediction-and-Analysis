# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis

## Introduction:
The main objective of the project is to predict customer churn, where churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. 

NOTE: This project is done as part of google advanced data analytics course, and Waze is a subsidiary company of Google that provides satellite navigation software on smartphones and other computers that support the Global Positioning System.

## Project Goals:

* Inspect user data to learn important relationships between variables - preliminary statistics.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Hypothesis Testing - Develop a two-sample hypothesis test to analyze and determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between mean number of rides and device type â€“ Android vs. iPhone.
* Apply user data to build and analyze a binomial logistic regression model.
* Building ML model - Develop a machine learning (ML) model that better predicts user churn.
