# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis

## Introduction:
The primary objective of this project is to predict customer churn, wherein churn signifies the count of users who have either uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using it.

NOTE: This project is done as part of google advanced data analytics course, and Waze is a subsidiary company of Google that provides satellite navigation software on smartphones and other computers that support the Global Positioning System.

## Project Goals:

* Inspect user data to learn important relationships between variables.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Hypothesis Testing - Develop a two-sample hypothesis test to analyze and determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between mean number of rides and device type – Android vs. iPhone.
* Apply user data to build and analyze a binomial logistic regression model.
* Model Building - Develop a machine learning (ML) model that better predicts user churn. 

## Work Done:
**Tools and Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy

* Collected preliminary statistics
* Analyzed user behavior 
* Performed EDA:
  * Discovering, Structuring, Cleaning, Joining, Validating and Presenting
  * Understood data distributiona, and relationships between variables through plots.
  * Created summary reports using Tableau
* Performed a two-sample t test to analyze and determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between mean number of rides and device type – Android vs. iPhone.
