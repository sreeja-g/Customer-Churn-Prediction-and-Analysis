# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis

## Introduction:
The primary objective of this project is to predict customer churn, wherein churn signifies the count of users who have either uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using it.

NOTE: This project is done as part of google advanced data analytics course, and Waze is a subsidiary company of Google that provides satellite navigation software on smartphones and other computers that support the Global Positioning System.

## Project Goals:

* Inspect user data to learn important relationships between variables.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Hypothesis Testing - Develop a two-sample hypothesis test to analyze and determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between mean number of rides and device type – Android vs. iPhone.
* Apply user data to build and analyze a binomial logistic regression model.
* Model Building - Develop a machine learning (ML) model that better predicts user churn. 

## Work Done:
**Tools and Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Tableau, sklearn, xgboost

* Gathered preliminary statistics.
* Analyzed user behavior.
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  * Discovered, structured, cleaned, joined, validated, and presented data.
  * Gained insights into data distributions and relationships between variables using plots.
  * Generated summary reports using Tableau.
* Conducted a two-sample t-test to analyze and determine whether a statistically significant difference exists between the mean number of rides based on device type – Android vs. iPhone.
* Engaged in feature selection, assessed features for multicollinearity, checked model assumptions, built, and evaluated a logistic regression model.
* Executed feature engineering, model selection, and fine-tuning. Explored the performance of random forest and XGBoost models on the dataset.
